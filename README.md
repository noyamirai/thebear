# Human Centered Design - Reimagine CCs

For the course "Human Centered Design" everyone was tasked to create an exclusive design for someone with a disability based on a problem that they are facing. The primary objective is to focus on understanding the perspective of the person we will be designing for, what their wishes and needs are and how to translate this into a prototype solution. Through interviews and testing with said person, we will gather the information needed to create a solution that has specifically been designed for them and figure out if it meets their needs and wishes.

intro

### Test plan
So, I created a pretty basic (in my opinion) closed caption prototype based on a scene from The Bear on YouTube. Before starting and going into the test with Marie and my group, I figured it would be best to establish a small test plan. I am mostly curious about whether or not the visual cue I made to indicate a phone ringing in the background, is clear and even noticable for Marie. Does she even see or notice it? (she could be focusing on reading the text instead) And does she know what it means/what it is supposed to indicate? 

I also want to know if she can feel and grasp the tense atmosphere of the scene. It's a pretty chaotic and hectic scene, as she mentioned herself before, with lots of things going on (offscreen). At one point during the scene, two characters (Sydney and Marcus), end up arguing with each other about priorities. During this argument, both characters talk over each other. I have created several different ways (for now) to try and show that the two characters are doing so: a version with 'basic' captions that shows the speech of both characters underneath each other, another version of captions underneath each other but with an additional speech icon above the captions (with and without explanatory text), and finally a version where I placed the speech icon next to the names of the characters.

I've also created a few effects for loud/shouting speeches that happen during the scene or characters that say something soft/from far away. So, I am also curious about what her thoughts are about this and if it conveys the emotion/tone/distance correctly for her. As for the context/scenario, she mentioned she mostly watches shows (and movies, but very rarely) at home on her TV, so for this test I would like her to imagine being at home and watching the scene on TV. 

Another thing I'm curious of are some other visual cues I created, but wasn't able to implement in this prototype. If there's time, I would like to show her the designs and get her thoughts about them.

**Summary of things I want to know:**
- Does Marie notice the visual cue on the bottom left side of the video?
- Does Marie understand what the visual cue tries to indicate?
- If Marie notices and understand the visual cue, does she find it helpful?
- Does Marie grasp the tense atmosphere of the scene? If not, what was missing or what was causing her to think otherwise?
- Does Marie understand that the two characters are talking over each other?
- Which version of the CC for characters talking over each other is the most helpful for Marie? Does she prefer a specific version or maybe neither?
- Do the style effects, such as animations or font sizing, convey the right emotion/tone/distance to Marie?
- If time left: would the visual cues on a video help Marie understanding a specific sound happened offscreen? Or might it be too much of a visual clutter?
